# java-journey
This repository documents my learning journey through the Java Programming Masterclass on Udemy. The goal is to learn the Java programming language from scratch â€” covering fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and real-world projects. I use this repo to organize notes, code exercises, and personal mini-projects.
